It is a visual simulator game that allows the teacher to encounter different student characters and choose responses to conflicts between the characters. This will allow teachers and teacherâ€™s aides to practice and become more comfortable with their responses to student peer-to-peer conflicts, and understand how differing personalities and backgrounds of students can affect their responses to teacher mediations.
